# python2048
This is a python version of 2048

Directions:
To run the pygame version, run the (https://github.com/Blue-Robin-Taken/python2048/blob/main/pygame2048/pygame2048.py) file. 


To run the text console version, run the (https://github.com/Blue-Robin-Taken/python2048/blob/main/main.py) file.

However, the files aren't EXE (I might add a version later) and you have to have python installed.
